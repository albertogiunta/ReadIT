        I\'m Alberto, an Italian developer who stopped counting unread articles on Pocket way too long ago.\n
        During Christmas Break \'17 I decided to make this app, so that I wouldn\'t miss out on any link that I wanted to read in 2018.\n
        I really hope you\'re gonna find it as useful as I do.
