# ReadIT - Links as a Story
> Never forget to read anything important again!

If you, like me, happen to have a ___never-ending list of links___, articles and blog posts on Pocket, you must know what that feels like.

*But fear no more, because ___with ReadIT that won't happen ever again___.*

In fact, once you share a link to ReadIT that *link lasts only for the next ___24 hours___*, just like those Instagram stories and Snapchat thingies we all love.

By saying that that interesting article you saw on your timeline will disappear if you don't read it, well guess what, chances are that you're actually gonna read it!

Hope you find this at least as useful as I do!
